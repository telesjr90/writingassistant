# Latest Roadmap Validation

- Date: 2026-06-12
- Result: PASS
- Command: `python scripts/validate_roadmap.py`
- Local command result: NOT AVAILABLE because `python` is not installed in this shell.
- Local command output: `/bin/bash: line 1: python: command not found`
- CI command expectation: PASS after `actions/setup-python@v5` provides Python 3.11 as `python`.
- Local equivalent command: `python3 scripts/validate_roadmap.py`
- Local equivalent result: PASS

## Checks

- Unique task IDs.
- Required top-level registry fields.
- Required fields on every task.
- Valid dependency references.
- Valid active frontier task ID.
- Active frontier title matches the canonical task title.
- `PHASE7-IMPL-004` exists.
- `PHASE7-IMPL-004` title is exactly `Chapter / Scene Metadata Compatibility Layer`.
- `PHASE7-IMPL-004` is not a validation task.
- `PHASE7-IMPL-010` exists.
- `PHASE7-IMPL-010` is type `validation`.
- Child task IDs have valid parents.
- Child task `parent` fields match the parent implied by the child task ID.
- Validation work does not reuse `PHASE7-IMPL-004` as its identity.
- Parent task IDs use only parent task types: `runtime` or `validation`.
- Child task IDs use only child micro-task types: `planning_microtask`, `runtime_microtask`, or `validation_microtask`.
- `PHASE7-IMPL-004` type is exactly `runtime`.
- `PHASE7-IMPL-004-T001` exists, is `planning_microtask`, has status `ready`, and belongs to `PHASE7-IMPL-004`.

## Git Checks

- `git diff --check`: PASS via hook-required wrapper `/home/tjrpirateking/.nvm/versions/node/v24.16.0/bin/lean-ctx -c 'git diff --check'`.
- `git status --short --branch`: PASS via hook-required wrapper `/home/tjrpirateking/.nvm/versions/node/v24.16.0/bin/lean-ctx -c 'git status --short --branch'`.

## Repairs Made

- Updated `scripts/validate_roadmap.py` to support `runtime`, `validation`, `planning_microtask`, `runtime_microtask`, and `validation_microtask`.
- Added parent-vs-child type enforcement.
- Added explicit `PHASE7-IMPL-004-T001` type/status/parent validation.
- Updated `docs/roadmap/roadmap_index.yaml` child task types under `PHASE7-IMPL-004`.
- Updated `docs/roadmap/implementation_status.md` to document child micro-task type usage.

## Notes

LeanCTX was used only as a local hook-required validation wrapper for the two git commands. It was not used for planning, context generation, file inspection, code search, summarization, exploration, CCE, Repomix, Graphify, MCP work, or broad repository discovery.

Minimal roadmap CI and `.context-engine.yaml` were created after the local validator passed with `python3`.
